# Load Balancer Test Application

A simple web application for load balancer and kubernetes ingress testing.
It listens on port 8080 and responds with the hostname.

The application will be built on docker hub.
```
$ docker pull jurgis/lb_tester
```

This application will be also used for test purpose so I can play with
docker build pipeline.
